Add reasoning-effort control and 6 new KIE LLM models (gpt-5.6-luna/terra/sol, gpt-5.5, claude-sonnet-5, claude-opus-4.8) end-to-end.

- `@nodaro/shared`: new `LLM_REASONING_EFFORTS` (`none`/`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`) + `LlmReasoningEffort` type, `EFFORT_TIER_BUMP` set, and `effectiveReasoningEffort()` helper (clamps a requested effort down to the highest level the target model actually supports). `LLM_MODELS` gains 6 new entries plus per-model `reasoningEfforts`, `supportsTemperature`, and `preferKie` capability fields. `buildLlmCreditIdentifier()` / `resolveLlmCreditId()` take an optional `reasoningEffort` third argument — `xhigh`/`max` (after clamping) bill one credit tier up (economy→standard, standard→premium, premium stays premium); `high` is the Claude-family server default and never bumps.
- `@nodaro/sdk`: prompt-helper wizard resources' `CommonInput` gains an optional `reasoningEffort` field, forwarded automatically by the existing request-builder spread.
- `@nodaro/cli`: `nodaro prompt` wizard subcommands gain a `--reasoning-effort <level>` flag (model-dependent; accepts `none|low|medium|high|xhigh|max`).

`grok-4.5` was evaluated but deferred — its KIE chat endpoint is not yet live, so no registry entry, rate row, or docs were added for it in this release.
