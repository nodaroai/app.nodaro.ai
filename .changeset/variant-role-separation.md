Variant + Role Separation for mention tokens: a non-mode 4th segment now parses as a per-mention **role** coexisting with the variant — `@kira:1:walking:clothes` attaches the walking image and injects "the clothes from …" (image and video resolvers; `@lib:1:weather/rain:lighting` for locations). Any role works, curated, custom, or `ref-only`. Every pre-existing token shape parses byte-identically; `CharacterMentionTokenInfo` gains an optional `role` field (mirroring the location parser's).
