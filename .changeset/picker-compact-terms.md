Compact professional `term` on every picker-catalog entry.

`@nodaro/prompts`: each catalog entry can now carry a short `term` beside its long `promptHint` — the two-to-four word phrase a professional would actually write in a prompt ("whip pan left", "hard cut", "medium close-up"). `label` stays what users see, `promptHint` is what models read in verbose hint mode, `term` is what they read in compact hint mode. New `term.ts` (`deriveTerm` / `isSuspiciousDerivedTerm` / `resolveTerm` / `TERM_MAX_CHARS`) plus a `get<Name>Term(id)` getter alongside every `get<Name>PromptHint(id)`, and roughly 1,370 explicit terms authored where the lowercased label is not the trade term. A guard test walks every registered catalog and fails for a suspicious label with no authored term, for a term over the length or word cap, and for two ids in one catalog that would inject the same fragment — so the convention is enforced rather than documented. `PickerOption.term` is always present and already resolved (`""` for a no-op "auto"/"none" entry that injects nothing) — including on options added by a catalog pack, which are resolved at composition so a pack built against an older `@nodaro/prompts` still injects in compact mode. Consumers render `label` and inject `term`, never deriving one from the other.

Where a catalog's grammar carries its meaning, the term keeps that grammar rather than leaving a consumer to re-add it: Material terms read `"made of polished gold"` (not `"polished gold"`, which would only name a material present in the scene) and Held Prop terms keep the held-in-hand verb (`"cradling a cat"`). Mood terms name the subject's expression, matching the register of their hints.

Selecting a register: `PickerHintMode` (`"full" | "compact"`) is exported from `term.ts`, the `build*Hints` family (`buildFramingHints`, `buildPersonHints`, `buildStylingHints`, `buildLightingHints`, …) takes an optional trailing `mode: PickerHintMode = "full"` so existing calls are unchanged, and `getParameterPromptHint` reads `data.hintMode` off the node — absent or unrecognized means `"full"`. A compact Camera Motion / Transition node propagates the mode into the pickers wired to its `startState` / `endState` handles; a wired picker that declares its own `hintMode` wins over what it inherits.

`@nodaro/shared`: `ProjectedCatalogOption` gains `term?: string` — the `GET /v1/catalogs` wire shape carries it at **both** detail levels, so a thin client rendering its own pickers gets the injectable term without a second `detail=full` fetch. The four object-entity catalogs (animals / vehicles / weapons / furniture) gain the same optional `term?` field, authored only where the label is a UI compound ("Airship / Dirigible" → `airship`, "Plasma Sword / Lightsaber" → `plasma sword`); everywhere else the label *is* the professional term and `@nodaro/prompts` derives it the same way it derives every other catalog's (lowercased, parentheticals stripped).

`@nodaro/sdk`: `PickerOption` and `ProjectedCatalogOption` mirror the new field, so `client.pickerCatalogs.get()` and `client.catalogs.list()` are typed for it at both detail levels.

`@nodaro/cli`: `nodaro catalog` snapshots now record an entry's `term`, and `diff-upstream`'s three-way merge counts a term-only upstream edit as a real content change — previously an upstream entry whose only edit was its `term` never reached a vendored pack's merge plan. That behaviour change is what makes this a minor rather than a patch. `nodaro pickers get` also documents `term` on its default (compact) detail level.
