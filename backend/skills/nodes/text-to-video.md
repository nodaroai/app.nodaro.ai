## Provider prompting doctrine

Model-family-specific prompting rules. Apply the section matching the node's `provider`.

### Seedance 2.0 (seedance-2, seedance-2-fast)

Prompt structure (front-load what matters most):
precise subject → action details → scene/environment → lighting & color tone → camera movement → visual style → image quality → constraints.

**Shots & pacing**
- Storyboard complex videos as "Shot 1: … Shot 2: … Shot 3: …" in event order. Do NOT attach timestamps (e.g. "(0-3s)") — precise-timing support is officially unstable and forcing durations can break generation; let the model pace naturally.
- Per shot cover, in order: camera move or transition, subject action + expression, spatial/position change, audio for that shot.
- One camera movement type per shot — never ask for push + pan + orbit at once (image instability).
- Prefer slow, gentle, continuous movements over high-burst action (sprints, big jumps, violent rolls morph). Describe actions per body part with quantified degree: "slowly raises a hand", "pushes hard off the ground". Chain actions with inertia: "uses the momentum of the turn to naturally raise an arm".
- Express emotion as externalized physical detail, never abstract words: not "very sad" but "lowering the head, shoulders trembling slightly, eyes reddening, fingers clutching the corner of clothing".

**References (when reference media is attached)**
- Refer to assets by ordinal in attachment order: "@Image 1", "Video 2", "Audio 1". Asset ORDER is priority — put the most identity-critical asset first.
- Define each subject once, then reuse the label consistently: 'Define the woman in the red dress in Image 1 as the courier' … 'the courier opens the door'. In multi-character scenes bind every character to its image ("the man from Image 1 hands the box to the woman from Image 2") and append: "do not generate duplicate copies of the same character".
- Character identity: ONE close-up headshot + ONE full-body image is ideal. Do NOT attach multi-view/three-view character sheets — the model reads the views as separate people, causing identity drift and twin duplicates.
- 4-5 assets total works best (1-2 character images + 1 scene image + 1 camera-movement video + 1 audio clip). Maxing out the 9-image/3-video/3-audio limits degrades feature priority and adherence.
- Editing/extension instructions name clips directly: "Extend Video 1 backward…", "Remove the chair from Video 1". Saying "reference Video 1" flips the model into reference mode and breaks the edit. Track completion: "Video 1 + [transition description] + followed by Video 2" (≤3 clips, ≤15s total).

**Audio (native multi-track: music + ambience + voice, stereo)**
- Cue the layers separately with the official symbols: full-width parentheses for music （slow jazz piano in the background）, angle brackets for sound effects <rain tapping on glass>, and dialogue as quoted speech: the man says "It's not that bad". Seedance also accepts curly-brace dialogue, but on Nodaro curly braces are reserved for prompt variables — always use quotes for dialogue here.
- Mark the language for non-English/Chinese dialogue ("says in Japanese …").
- With a reference voice attached, also describe the timbre in words: "the low, warm, finely grainy middle-aged male voice of Audio 1".

**Quality & constraints**
- Quality tail: "HD, rich details, cinematic texture, natural colors, stable picture."
- Anti-junk constraints (these official templates ARE negative-form): "keep it subtitle-free", "avoid generating any text or subtitles", "do not generate a watermark", "do not generate a logo". Landscape output is markedly less subtitle-prone than portrait — generate 16:9 and crop when portrait text-safety matters.
- There is NO negative-prompt parameter on Seedance — all constraints belong in the prompt text itself.

**Known weaknesses → workarounds**
- Text rendering is weak: keep on-screen text to short common words; for exact text or logos, attach the artwork as a reference image and instruct "the logo from Image N stays in the corner unchanged".
- More than 4 referenced people gets unstable: group people into composite images of ≤4 first (image generation), then reference those composites.
- Repeated extension degrades quality: prefer high-definition reference assets and avoid stacking many continuations.
